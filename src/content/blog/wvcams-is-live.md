I'm excited to finally share something I’ve been working on: [**WVCams.com**](https://wvcams.com) — a simple, fast way to check live traffic cams across West Virginia.

If you’ve ever tried to pull up road conditions in winter or check a highway before a long drive, you’ve probably run into slow, outdated tools. I wanted something better, something that just works. So I built it.

WVCams lets you instantly view highway cameras across the state, organized by county. It loads fast, looks clean on your phone, and doesn’t require any app or login. Just open the site and you're good to go.

### Why I Built It

I live in West Virginia, and like a lot of folks here, I spend a fair amount of time on the road. Snow, accidents, construction — sometimes a quick glance at a traffic cam is all it takes to decide your route. But getting that glance shouldn’t be so frustrating.

So I made WVCams lightweight, mobile-friendly, and built to handle real-world use. I’m using server-side rendering (Astro) for speed and reliability, and I’ve kept the design minimal so it doesn’t get in your way.

### What’s Next

This is just version one. I’m already planning features like:

- Search by city or route  
- Implementing live traffic data

If you have suggestions, I’m all ears. WVCams is for all of us who just want a better way to see what’s happening on the roads.
