                    <p>
                        I'm a full stack developer based in West Virginia with a
                        passion for clean code, scalable systems, and building
                        tools that actually get used. I specialize in
                        cloud-native architecture, modern JavaScript frameworks,
                        and secure systems for government and enterprise
                        clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether it’s developing a real-time traffic camera
                        platform for West Virginia drivers or integrating
                        conversational AI into robotics, I enjoy turning complex
                        problems into intuitive experiences. I build with speed,
                        reliability, and long-term maintainability in mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of work, I’m always tinkering—whether it’s
                        automating something with Python, deploying services to
                        a Raspberry Pi, or experimenting with local AI models. I
                        believe great software is both invisible and impactful.
